My name is Kumar Bhot. I facilitate software engineering teams for self-sufficiency, high performance, and continuous improvement. I’m unconventional, curious, and thought-provoking. As much as I enjoy reading and listening, I’m also a writer and speaker—a proud mono speaker. I’m a wallflower and a bold introvert.

During the two and half decades of my career in the software industry, I was very fortunate to play almost every role that a software product team has to offer. Graphics Designer, Usability Analyst, User Experience Designer, UI Developer, Frontend Architect, Backend Developer, Database Designer, QA Automation Engineer, and Product Owner. Apart from everything else, I was also invested heavily in Product Management and Technical Writing during my short and failed entrepreneurship stunt. Among all my work experiences, the tenure at Dell probably remains the most learning one. Not only did I have to engineer products on a huge scale, but I also got to lead the engineering process maturity efforts with Scrum actively. It was a multi-aspect enhancement to my career with technology, people, and process knowledge boost. The extraordinarily talented individuals and leaders I worked with made it unforgettable.

I admire passion for software product development and a no-nonsense approach to engineering leadership. During the two and half decades of my career in the software industry, I have been saddened by the waste we continuously create and surprised with the 'engineering' label we proudly decorate our field with. In my honest opinion, this happens due to two primary reasons. First, we have forgotten the meaning of the word 'engineering'. And second, our technical leaders are missing something crucial.

My friend Piyush described ‘German Engineering’ fascinatingly, which stuck with me forever. *When a German Engineer is asked to make a perfect sphere, she will create an instrument and a process that anybody can use to create a perfect sphere*. That is my definition of engineering—an excellent application of science.

Happy, diverse, and synchronized engineering teams can push innovation to its limits. I remain inspired by history and believe in standing on the shoulders of our previous generation of engineers. The impeccable production efficiency the Automobile Industry achieved is hard to ignore. As scientific as the Best Engineering Practices are, there is a lot of sense and logic in the evolution journey from chaos to Waterfall to Lean to Agile and Scrum.

I dedicate most of my time to the two important initiatives: (1) [Better Professional](https://betterprofessional.org), and (2) Management Engineering

'Better Professional' is nothing but an attempt to explain simple practical improvements that will help you rise from a suffering mediocre performer to a thriving and fulfilling career champion.
